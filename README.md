# Info Extractor

## Objective

Summary - This project entails preparing a script to automate retrieval of system and network information of the machine from where it is run, for example public & internal IP, memory utilisation and active services. 

Aim - This project aims to familiarise (and test) students on typical Linux commands to extract such information, text manipulation needed to isolate specific portions, and how to prepare this in a script. The likely longer term intent of this project is provide a basic framework for more complex scripting subsequently - for instance when enumerating an unfamiliar network or conducting brute forcing of several machines. 

### Skills Learned

- Bash scripting
- Linux fundamentals, file system
